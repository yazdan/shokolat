#Shokolat
Shokolat(Persian word for candy) is a simple caching http proxy. Simply it is developed as way to schedule PS4 downloads in night as a replacement of psx download helper.


#TODO
- ~~serve file from local directory~~
- Use Aria2c as downloader inestead of simple implementation
- Decide if just file names are important or pathes are also important
- ~~Use regular expersion to check if the request must be served from cache or just proxy it~~
- ~~Don't serve files that are not downloaded and return 403~~
- Configuration parameters
- Decide about HTTPS support.
- Improve documentation and readme
