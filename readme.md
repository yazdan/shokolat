#TODO
- ~~serve file from local directory~~
- Use Aria2c as downloader inestead of simple implementation
- Decide if just file names are important or pathes are also important
- ~~ Use regular expersion to check if the request must be served from cache or just proxy it ~~
- ~~ Don't serve files that are not downloaded and return 403~~
- Configuration parameters
- Decide about HTTPS support.
